# What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library that allows you to build stateful, multi-step, and multi-agent applications using a graph-based architecture.

Instead of linear chains (like in LangChain), it lets you build dynamic workflows that can loop, branch, and track state intelligently.


# 🧠 Real-Life Use Case: “AI Startup Co-Pilot”

## 🎯 Scenario:
You’re building an **AI-powered Startup Co-Pilot** with multiple agents to help a founder.

### 🤖 Agents:
- **Researcher Agent** – searches the web for trends
- **Marketing Agent** – suggests a branding strategy
- **Finance Agent** – gives budget estimates
- **Product Agent** – designs a feature roadmap

### 🏁 Goal:
The founder types:

> “I want to build a fitness app for teenagers in India.”

The agents collaborate to give:
- Market research summary
- Suggested features
- Branding ideas
- Budget and timeline

## 😩 Problems with Traditional LangChain Agents

LangChain’s agent framework works well for simple flows, but struggles with multi-agent orchestration.

### 🔴 1. No Clear State Management
- Hard to track progress across agents
- No shared intermediate thoughts
- Cannot store and update the evolving context

LangChain agents are mostly **linear** or **tree-based**, not built for **cyclical or parallel workflows**.

---

### 🔴 2. Hard to Orchestrate Multiple Agents
- LangChain agents act **independently**
- Built around single-step reasoning (ReAct, ToolUse, etc.)
- No way to **delegate tasks** across agents

---

### 🔴 3. Can’t Handle Multi-Hop Reasoning
- Agent A might need Agent B’s help
- Agent B might revise based on Agent A's response
- Need for **retries**, **loops**, **conditional decisions** → not easily supported in LangChain

## ✅ Why Use LangGraph for Multi-Agent Reasoning?

LangGraph supports **stateful, directed graphs**, solving all the above challenges.

| Feature                     | LangChain | LangGraph |
|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Memory per node            | ❌        | ✅        |
| Cycles/loops               | ❌        | ✅        |
| Multi-agent orchestration  | 🟡        | ✅        |
| Intermediate state sharing | ❌        | ✅        |
| Branching logic            | Limited   | ✅        |

Each box is a **LangGraph node**. State (`dict`) is passed and updated as agents execute in sequence or loop.

## 💡 Core Concepts
| Concept   | Description                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node**  | A function or chain (e.g., LLM call, DB lookup, API call)                        |
| **Edge**  | Connects nodes (defines the path between them)                                   |
| **State** | A shared dictionary that holds memory, variables, and user input                 |
| **Graph** | The whole structure — a DAG (directed acyclic graph), sometimes cyclic if needed |

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Conversational bots with looping
- Multi-agent reasoning (e.g., user talks to tech support → forwards to finance if needed)
- Tool-using agents with stateful control flow
- Complex workflows like planner + executor architectures
